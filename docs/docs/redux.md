FastUI uses [Redux state management][Redux]
[![Redux Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redux-764ABC?logo=redux&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)][Redux]
instead of [React state management][useState] for a much more maintainable decoupling of React components.

:::tip[When is React state management better]

We recommend using React state management when the state is scoped in a single node in DOM tree, because in this case
Redux as a global management would be an overkill and React state management would not suffer
[prop-drilling](https://react.qubitpi.org/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) at all

:::

The template has already been configured with 2 states

1. a string variable named `myState1`
2. a boolean variable called `myState2`

```typescript
import { selectMyState1, setMyState1, setMyState2 } from "fast-ui-redux";

function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {
  const myState1 = useAppSelector(selectMyState1);
  const myState2 = useAppSelector(selectMyState2);

  console.log(setMyState1);

  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  dispatch(setMyState2(false));
}

export default App;
```
