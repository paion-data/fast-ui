FastUI is a methodology for creating monorepo React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Creating a Repository from GitHub Template

We can click on this link to generate a repository using the template:
[Create a new repository](https://github.com/paion-data/fast-ui/generate) from paion-data/fast-ui.
Alternatively, we can visit the [fast-ui repository on GitHub](https://github.com/paion-data/fast-ui) and
click on the "Use this template" button on the top-right.

In both cases, the next steps are:

1. Enter a name for the new repository.
2. Uncheck "Include all branches".
3. Click on "Create repository from template".

For more details on how to create repositories using template, read the article on the GitHub website:
[Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

:::caution

If the repository is public, GitHub offers unlimited free build minutes. If it's a private repository, however,
[billing policy](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes)
applies

:::

## After Creating the Repository

At this point, A ReactJS project with just what we need to start quickly has been generated. Developer can now
start adding business value and **get work done much faster in a standard way**. The following sections of this
documentation contain further details on how to proceed next.

:::note

The following steps apply to the newly created repository, not the paion-data/fast-ui template repository.

:::

### Quick Start

```console
yarn
yarn start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see the app. When we are ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle
with

```console
yarn build
```

That's it. We don't need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that
we can focus on the code.

### Scripts

Inside the newly created project, we can run some built-in commands:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page automatically reloads
if we make changes to the code. we will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

![](img/screencast-error.svg)

#### `yarn test`

Runs the unit tests

#### `yarn cypress:open` and `yarn e2e`

Opens Cypress End-to-End test console and runs the End-to-End tests, respectively

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build
for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Our app is ready to be deployed.

### Enabling Automatic Deployment to GitHub Pages

Navigate to [.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml](https://github.com/paion-data/fast-ui/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml)
and change the `documentation-ci-cd` to a new definition called `deploy` as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````diff

  push:
    branches:
      - master

- Please replace `MyGitHubUsername` and `myemail@email.com` accordingly
- The `CNAME` file will be the domain where the React app will be hosted. If no domain is planned to be attached at this
  moment, simply remove this step please

### Enabling Argos Visual Testing

To enable the [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/),
[create an Argos project](https://argos-ci.com/docs/github#import-a-github-repository-to-argos) first. To upload
snapshot to Argos CI, an `ARGOS_TOKEN` is required and can be obtained after creating the Argos project.

After getting the `ARGOS_TOKEN` token, add it as a repository secret:

1. In the newly created repository, select **Settings**
2. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** followed by **Actions**
3. Press the button **New repository secret**
4. Enter the name of the secret as `ARGOS_TOKEN`
5. Paste the token from the project on Argos CI
6. Be sure there are no spaces before or after the token and/or linebreaks after the token
7. Save the secret by selecting **Add secret**

:::info

For more information on GitHub Secrets, please refer to the GitHub documentation:
[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

### Enabling sentry.io Application Monitoring

#### Creating a Sentry Project

In order to capture errors and other events, we need to have a project set up in Sentry. This section walks through how
to create a new project in our Sentry account. We need to have a project set up in Sentry in order to capture errors and
other events.

:::tip

For more information, see sentry.io's documentation on
[best practices for creating projects](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/getting-started/#4-create-projects).

:::

Follow the steps below to create a new Sentry project for a our React application:

1. Log in to your [Sentry organization](https://sentry.io/).
2. Select **Projects** from the left side navigation menu to display the list of all our projects.
3. Click **Create Project** and configure it as appropriate for our application:

- **Choose your platform**: Select the language or framework for our project based on the code we wish to monitor.
  In this case, choose **React** ![](img/sentry-react-icon.png).
- **Set your alert frequency**: For the purpose of our setup, select **I'll create my own alerts later**.
  :::tip

  Learn more about how to set up your alerts in [Alerts Best Practices](https://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/best-practices/)

  :::

- **Name your project and assign it a team**: Name the project in the **Project name** field and assign a team by
  selecting one in the **Team** dropdown (or click **+** to create a new team).
- Click **Create Project**. This takes us to the quick Configure React SDK guide, which provides an overview of how
  to configure the SDK. This section covers the SDK setup in more detail.

4. Copy the DSN key and keep it handy. Each project has a unique DSN (Data Source Name). The DSN tells the SDK where to
   send events, so events are associated with the right project. We'll need to paste the DSN key into our source code
   later so the errors generated in the React app go to our new project.

We can also find a project's DSN anytime in **\[Project\]** > **Settings** > **Client Keys (DSN)**.

##### UI Walkthrough

import { Arcade } from "../src/components/arcade";

<Arcade src="https://demo.arcade.software/IUuJGLUBdRIa2yBFE35v?embed" />

#### Adding the Sentry SDK to Project

Open [src/index.tsx](https://github.com/paion-data/fast-ui/blob/master/packages/fast-ui-app/src/index.tsx) and change the
following lines of code as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````diff
  Sentry.init({
-   dsn: "https://5e82dcf741091e63d616982f0cbcf0e5@o4505480921022464.ingest.us.sentry.io/4508702863589376",
+   dsn: "<your_DSN_key>",
````

where `<your_DSN_key>` is the DSN obtained in previous step.

The template configuration enables Sentry's error monitoring feature, as well as its
[Performance](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/) (tracing) and
[Session Replay](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/session-replay/) features.

#### Configuring Source Maps Upload

FastUI supports uploading source maps to sentry.io with
[webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin). We only need to configure an
[Organization Auth Token](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/) and FastUI will do
all of the rests. After getting the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` token, add it as a repository secret:

1. In the newly created repository, select **Settings**
2. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** followed by **Actions**
3. Press the button **New repository secret**
4. Enter the name of the secret as `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
5. Paste the token
6. Be sure there are no spaces before or after the token and/or linebreaks after the token
7. Save the secret by selecting **Add secret**

At last, add the following CI/CD config to the
[automatic deployment logic](#enabling-automatic-deployment-to-github-pages):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````diff
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

    ...

      - name: Test production build
        run: yarn build
+       env:
+         SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
      - name: Load CNAME

    ...
````

## Developing App

### Automatically Formatting Codebase

When CI/CD complains about "Code style check" as the following:

![](./img/cicd-code-style-check-error-example.png)

Simply run the following command at project root which will auto formatting the codebase using Prettier:

```console
yarn prettier --ignore-path .gitignore . --write
```

:::tip

It's always a good practice to auto-formatting code whenever convenient <img src="https://github.com/QubitPi/QubitPi/blob/master/img/%E5%BF%83%E6%B5%B7.png?raw=true" width="60px" />

:::

### Importing SVG

```typescript live
import MySvg from "./example.svg"

function MyComponent(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div className="svgIcon">
      <img src={MySvg} alt="MySvg" />
    </div>
);
}
```
